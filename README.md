# zooce.github.io

This is where I'll host my personal "blog" of sorts _(it's not really a blog, more of a colletion of thoughts/ideas that I think might be helpful to others...is that what a blog is?)_.

I build this with [`mdBook`](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook) and [`github-pages-deploy-action`](https://github.com/JamesIves/github-pages-deploy-action).
